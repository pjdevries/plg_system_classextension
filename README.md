# Joomla! Core Class Extension Plugin

This system plugin allows the adaptation and extension of 
Joomla! or 3rd party core classes.

This is an old version of the plugin, which is no longer maintained. 
The new version can be found here: https://github.com/pjdevries/plg_system_classextender. 
It is just a name change, in order to get accepted by the Joomla! Extension Directory.
Under the hood nothing has changed. If you were using this plugin, uninstall it
and install the renamed version. It will enable you to easily update whenever 
a new version is released.
